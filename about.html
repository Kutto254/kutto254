                        The flower Museum explores and celebrates the art, 
                        history and design of British gardens and their place in our lives today.

                        Visitors will discover the stories of great gardeners through a permanent 
                        collection of artefacts and tools from gardening throughout history 
                        alongside botanical art, photography, and paintings exploring how and why we garden. 
                        Exhibitions, events, and community projects delve into art, architecture, plant science, 
                        food, sustainability, well-being and more, all through the lens of gardening.

                        The Museum of Floral Culture is new tourist’s attraction especially developed for 
                        those who love floral arts and those who are interested in art and culture 
                        with special focus on floral culture which is an important part of the way of life. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Museum of Floral Culture also exhibits important floral cultures from civilizationsall over the
                        world. In the exhibits, we employ photographs, artifacts, tools and equipments—used in the creation 
                        of floral arts—along with fresh flowers to tell the stories. 
                        We would not want to be misleading, but please kindly note not to expect extravagant floral 
                        displays as you would see in a flower show.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Museum of Floral Culture is located in the quiet residential area. 
                        Built in the reign of Kings, The Museum of Floral Culture is a beautifully preserved 
                        covering the total ground of 1,800 square meters of an impeccably-landscaped garden.
                        There's a little tea shop as part of the museum, and you will definitely want to stop in for a
                        pot of tea and Asian sweets after your tour.
